SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION:
              Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to understand the relationship between two continuous variables. It assumes that there is a linear relationship between the independent variable (predictor) and the dependent variable (outcome). The goal is to fit a straight line to the data points that minimizes the difference between the observed values and the values predicted by the line. This line is characterized by its slope and intercept. The slope represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable, while the intercept is the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero. Simple linear regression is commonly used for prediction and inference, providing insights into how changes in one variable affect another.

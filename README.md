# Linear Regression models
1)SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION:
              Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to understand the relationship between two continuous variables. It assumes that there is a linear relationship between the independent variable (predictor) and the dependent variable (outcome). The goal is to fit a straight line to the data points that minimizes the difference between the observed values and the values predicted by the line. This line is characterized by its slope and intercept. The slope represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable, while the intercept is the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero. Simple linear regression is commonly used for prediction and inference, providing insights into how changes in one variable affect another.
              The formula for a simple linear regression is:
                                          Y=b+mX

              
2)MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION:
              Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is a statistical technique that uses two or more explanatory (independent) variables to predict the outcome of a response (dependent) variable1. The goal of MLR is to model the linear relationship between the explanatory variables and the response variable1.
      The formula for a multiple linear regression is:
                                   Y=b0​+b1​X1​+b2​X2​+b3​X3​+...+bn​Xn​
